Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

- We planned to do a game in which you count the number of animals and input the answer - if correctly answered image would change to the next and so on. A scoreboard would then be created to store your game data/score. We were able to accomplish this.
- As a stretch we wanted another level below with a different game containing draggable elements. Although the draggable elements were made I was unable to quantify a result from this game and connect it to the database. Also I was unable to do a popup.

If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

- I found the draggable game section very difficult
- I found inputting media queries to make the website accessible for mobiles difficult as the main-image-container would continously get cut off from the sides (I think i got the main image accessible on a mobile now but definetley not the draggable game)

What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?

- We had some issues with pulling and merging requests from github as well as some pull conflicts - but we resolved these effectively as a team.
- We had issues with render and inputting images/audio in a public folder but we resolved these with assistance
